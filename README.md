## Project Abstract
A local university wants to develop a new interactive system – CLIUniApp - that offers access totwo interactive subsystems for students and admins separately. CLIUniApp stores students’ data intoa local file students.data, with all CRUD operations interacting with this file.Students accessing the student subsystem have the choice to login (if they are previously registered)or register. A registered student can enrol in a maximum of four (4) subjects, remove a subject,change password, and view enrolment.Admins already exist in the system and do not need to register. An admin using the admin subsystemcan remove a student from the students.data, partition students to PASS/FAIL categories, groupstudents by grade, view all students, and clear all student data.
